# Power-BI-Database
In this we perform operations on the raw data collected from the internet in the form of Excel sheet and perform various Power BI Queries to transform it first.
Then I created various visualisations like pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, filled maps, stacked bar and column charts, gauges, cards, etc. 
Database also has the layout designed for both mobile and laptop.
